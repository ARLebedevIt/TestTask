# About

### Test task with a list of posts
<p>The TA implements the following functions: output of posts with filtering by users and a quantitative limit, adding comments to posts, output of notifications to Routing and user actions.</p>
<p></p>During the development, the Material UI library was used, I worked with it for the first time, as well as TypeScript and Axios</p>
<p></p>Additionally, I made a 'Dark' and 'Light' theme, dynamically changing URL + data request via URL n-r (?userId={number}, posts/{number})</p>
